## Funday Description
Funday is an app in which you can manage projects and tasks using boards. A board contains groups and tasks. Usually each project is a board, and the gro and cards are the tasks and subjects to do in the project. Users can modify the board and change list and card locations using Drag and Drop.
Users can work together and watch live changes. 
There are many other features in Funday, such as labels, due date for tasks, members and more. 
We added AI helper with voice recording so you can record a task and get it broken into smaller tasks by chatGPT. 
More about it in the [features section](#application-features).

## Application Features
- Create ***Boards*** and manage projects: Using ***D&D***, create, remove, and update lists and tasks.
- Create, edit and archive ***Task*** to the deepest level: Labels, Due date, Members, Cover images, Checklists, Activity log, Copy, Move and Archive.
- ***Side Menu:*** - Change the background of the board with the ***Unsplash Photo API***, ***Filtering*** by members / labels and General ***Activity*** Log!
- Google Login, along with regular authentication which is encrypted and safe.

In addition, we created Blind Color Mode, in which you can recognize the labels and cover colors by signs.
We have added a voice assistant which can accept vocal commands and help manage products with no effort! For example, you can filter, create board and more.
Of course that we included all the small nuances Trello has. You are not supposed to find any differences! 

## Technologies

The technology stack we used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js.
The app uses webSockets to update the board in real-time.
The API calls to the backend are done with the REST API method , and we used middlewares to authenticate and authorize actions.

We have used many thirs side libraries for many goals, such as the cloudinary, monday-ui-style ,react-particles-js, D&D and more.
The layout and pixel-perfect were made with SASS (functions, mixins, variables). 

## Getting started

Head to the repository on top and clone the project or download the files.

```
git clone https://github.com/galbarcessat/funday.git
git clone https://github.com/galbarcessat/funday-backend.git
```

Enter the backend folder and make sure you have node_modules installed. After that we will initiate the server with 'npm start':

```
npm i 
npm start
```

You should get a console ouput that the server is up and running at port 3030.
Enter the frontend folder and repeat the same process.

```
npm i 
npm run dev
```

You shuold get a console ouput that the server is up and running at localhost:5173.

That's it! The App should be opened automatically, enjoy!

### Kanban view
The menu on the right which is opened by the pressing the "Show menu" button enables the user to filter members by labels / name, change the board background with unsplash Images, watch the archived tasks (and bring it back to the board) and watch the activity of the board (who did what and when, and to navigate to those tasks).
